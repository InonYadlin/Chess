Chess Game Project
  Overview
  This is a simple chess game implemented in C++ with a basic Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
  The project allows two players to move chess pieces on a standard 8x8 board. 
  However, this implementation does not include check or win conditions,
  meaning players are free to move pieces without restrictions related to the game-ending scenarios.

Features
  1. Basic Chess Mechanics: Allows two players to move chess pieces alternately.
  2. Graphical Interface: Simple GUI to visualize the chessboard and piece movements.
  3. Move Validation: Basic piece movement rules are followed (e.g., bishops move diagonally, rooks move horizontally/vertically).
  4. No Check/Checkmate: The game does not track or enforce check, checkmate, or stalemate conditions.
  5. No Win Condition: The game does not recognize or enforce a win condition.
